The goal of a `binfer` pipeline is to output a data frame that contains draws from the posterior distribution of the parameter of interest. To demonstrate, we'll use the `taxis` dataset included in the package. In the interest of run times, we'll subsample the data to only 10% of the rows.

```{r setup}
library(binfer)
library(tidyverse)

data("taxis")

taxis <- taxis %>% 
  sample_frac(.1)
```

This dataset consist of information about yellow cab rides in New York City over the course of about an hour.

```{r explore-data}
glimpse(taxis)
```
